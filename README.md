# Portfolio

Projects listed above:

Solar wind PDF: project report of Monte Carlo simulations on high and low energy particles and how they interact with the Earth's magnetic field. Created using matlab differential equation solver to model the positions of the particles.

MancalaAI ipynb: Python notebook showcasing a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning applied to Mancala. Explores the accuracy and runtime vs the depth in which the AI plays.

Tennis Reservation App: Designed and created the database that allows users to reserve courts or join other reservations. Including to this, I designed routes that update, insert, and display info, and allow the user to create a search radius based on their zip code.

Arcane: Submodule to the OOP orientated dungeon game, Arcane. Arcane is implemented using design patterns such as observers, factories, builders, and more. I also utilized certain libraries to display a simple maze and audible tts. The project is run in intellij and focuses on TDD and shows full coverage.
